# WG API Sharp library #

## Description ##
**[WG API Sharp](https://github.com/just0rz/wg-api-sharp-library/wiki/WGAPISharp)** is a library which should help people using .Net/C# to interact with WarGaming [API](https://developers.wargaming.net/).  
For the moment the main target is to cover all methods exposed related to World of Tanks, but in the future(when I'm fully happy with it) I will extend it to support the rest too.  
  
For more details about the roadmap, etc. I use the [wiki](https://github.com/just0rz/wg-api-sharp-library/wiki). I never used github until now, so I'm learning as I go. :)
